# Warriors Series Cover Comparison

I wanted to take a closer look into the art style changes for the individual series within the _Warriors_ franchise. As you will see, these changes range from minute color or shape changes to drastically altering the design of the covers. Not all series will be discussed here, we will be focusing on series whose covers are featured within this collection.

The first series we will take a look at is series two **The New Prophecy**

These book covers feature a character that is typically heavily involved in the novel in a rectangular box in the center of the cover. The nature scenes in the background of the covers also contain scenery of the lands that the cats are currently traveling through. The spines of the book covers are slightly darker in color compared to the front and back covers of the books. Finally, all of the book covers in this series use lots of blue tones of varying hues to visually connect the covers together.

Next is series three **The Power of Three**

The Power of Three began a trend in _Warriors_ books of changing the center shape to a circle instead of the previously used rectangle. Some of the center character portraits also feature multiple characters such as in book one _The Sight_. Another change is that the spines of the book covers are now uniform with the rest of the artwork on the covers, creating one large background painting featured around the entire dust jacket of each book.

---

Now we will look at series four **Omen of the Stars**

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cov-4-2.png;cov-4-4.png" %}

This series is fairly similar to the Power of Three in cover design. This does make some sense considering that these two story arcs are very intertwined with eachother and even feature most of the same main characters. The only main difference is that the character portraits in the center of the covers have more detail put into them.

---

Then we skip ahead to series seven **The Broken Code**

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cov-7-5.png;cov-7-6.png" %}

This series shows the drastic art style change from Wayne McLoughlin to Owen Richardson. Gone are covers that have two distinct sections, a face featured in the center with a background behind. Now a large face is seen in the center of the page, almost taking over the cover. Then at the bottom is a small scene featued within the book. The spines of the book no longer match the front and back covers because instead all of the spines for series seven all make an image when the books are lined up in order.

Finally, lets take a look at the **Graphic Novels**

{% include feature/image.html objectid="cov-man-3.png;cov-man-4.png" %}

The graphic novels are illustrated by James L. Barry. They continue to use the character designs featured on the previous book covers but with more of a cartoon style to aid in the visual storytelling. These covers still feature the main character of the book in the center of the page, but instead of separating the face of the character from the background, it is one large image. Depending on the book, some covers have artwork that spans the entire dust jacket, while others are broken up by the spine.
