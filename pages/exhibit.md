Warriors Series Cover Comparison
 ---

I wanted to take a closer look into the art style changes for the individual series within the _Warriors_ franchise. As you will see, these changes range from minute color or shape changes to drastically altering the design of the covers. Not all series will be discussed here, we will be focusing on series whose covers are featured within this collection.

---

The first series we will take a look at is series two **The New Prophecy**

These book covers feature a character that is typically heavily involved in the novel in a rectangular box in the center of the cover. The nature scenes in the background of the covers also contain scenery of the lands that the cats are currently traveling through. The spines of the book covers are slightly darker in color compared to the front and back covers of the books. Finally, all of the book covers in this series use lots of blue tones of varying hues to visually connect the covers together.

Next is series three **The Power of Three**

The Power of Three began a trend in _Warriors_ books of changing the center shape to a circle instead of the previously used rectangle. Some of the center character portraits also feature multiple characters such as in book 1 _The Sight_. Another change is that the spines of the book covers are now uniform with the rest of the artwork on the covers, creating one large background painting featured around the entire dust jacket of each book.

Now we will look at series four **Omen of the Stars**
