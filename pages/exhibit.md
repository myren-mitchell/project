Warriors Series Cover Comparison
 ---
{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="My Exhibit" %}

I wanted to take a closer look into the art style changes for the individual series within the _Warriors_ franchise. As you will see, these changes range from minute color or shape changes to drastically altering the design of the covers. Not all series will be discussed here, we will be focusing on series whose covers are featured within this collection.

The first series we will take a look at is series two **The New Prophecy**
