## About the Collection

This collection aims to explore the artwork featured on the covers of the Warriors novels written by Erin Hunter. This series has been ongoing since January of 2003 and currently features over 70 books ranging from field guides to graphic novels.

Three artists have been credited with creating artwork for this series, Owen Richardson, Wayne McLoughlin, and James L. Barry. This website aims to compare the different  styles of these artists and visually see the evolution of the cover art over time. Different types of Warriors books tend to have different designs, so visitors can also observe the differences in covers between the main series novels, super editions, and graphic novels.

All artwork featured on this website belongs to the original artists and HarperCollins publishing company. The images are being used for educational purposes only.
